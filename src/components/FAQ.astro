  {
    question: "Do I need to give you access to our CRM or internal systems?",
    answer: "No. We only need your watchlist (company names, key people, sectors). Monitoring happens externally, briefs are delivered via email.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you source the news?",
    answer: "We aggregate from public sources—press releases, industry publications, regulatory filings, company announcements—then filter and format what's relevant to your watchlist.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to change the watchlist during the free week?",
    answer: "Easy. Just email us the changes and we'll update the monitoring same day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see a sample before committing to the free week?",
    answer: "Yes. Book the 15-minute setup call and I'll show you a mock brief based on a sample portfolio before we configure yours.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after the free week if I don't continue?",
    answer: "Nothing. No payment, no follow-up unless you ask for it. The monitoring just stops.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from Google Alerts or Bloomberg?",
    answer: "Google Alerts generate 90% noise. Bloomberg costs €24K/year and requires someone to extract what's relevant. We deliver pre-filtered, actionable intelligence at a fraction of the cost.",
  },
