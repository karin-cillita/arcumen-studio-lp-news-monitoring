## The Invisible Problem

You find out a portfolio company raised Series B three weeks after it happened. A key executive left, and you hear about it on LinkedIn. A client's competitor got acquired, and nobody on your team knew to reach out.

These aren't isolated incidents. They're symptoms of a gap: brilliant professionals with excellent networks, but no systematic way to monitor what matters. The opportunities don't disappear—they just go to whoever showed up informed.

## Portfolio News Monitoring

### What it is

A daily or weekly digest of relevant news for the companies and sectors you track. We monitor funding announcements, M&A activity, leadership changes, regulatory shifts, and industry developments—then deliver what matters directly to your inbox.

No dashboards to check. No alerts to configure. No manual searching. Just the information you need, formatted for action.

### What it does

**Never miss an outreach trigger**  
Portfolio company raises Series B? Key exec leaves? Acquisition announced? You know immediately—not three weeks later when someone mentions it on LinkedIn.

**Show up informed when it matters**  
Walk into conversations with current context. Reference recent developments. Maintain the "always in the loop" presence that builds trust.

**Reclaim time spent on manual monitoring**  
Stop scrolling news sites, setting Google Alerts that don't work, or asking associates to track updates. It happens automatically.

### How it works

**Week 1: Free trial**  
We build your custom monitoring setup and deliver one week of news briefs. No payment required.

**After that: You decide**  
If it's valuable, continue for **€1,500** (one-time build fee) + **€500/month** for managed monitoring. If not, no hard feelings.

## Once You See How This Works...

Most clients start with portfolio news monitoring, then add:

**Meeting Prep Briefs**  
Automated dossiers before every scheduled call. Company background, recent news, relationship history—compiled automatically.

**Relationship Coverage Alerts**  
Know when key contacts haven't heard from you in 60/90/120 days. Stop letting relationships go cold.

**Outreach Ghostwriter**  
Draft personalized emails based on triggers and contact context. Maintain your voice, eliminate the blank page problem.

These automations work together as a full revenue operations system—but you don't need to buy the bundle upfront. Start with what matters most, expand when you're ready.

## How It Works

**1. Onboarding call (15 minutes)**  
You share your watchlist—portfolio companies, target accounts, key sectors. We discuss what triggers matter most.

**2. Build (2-3 days)**  
We configure the monitoring, test the filters, and deliver your first sample brief for review.

**3. Free week starts**  
Briefs arrive daily or weekly (your choice). See what you've been missing. Adjust the watchlist anytime.

**4. You decide**  
If it's valuable, continue. If not, walk away—no payment, no awkwardness.

## Who This Is For

**This works best for:**

- Boutique PE funds tracking portfolio companies and deal pipeline
- Family offices monitoring investments and founder networks  
- Strategy consultants watching client sectors and competitive moves
- Investment banks covering target accounts and M&A activity

**Not a fit if:**

- You need enterprise integrations or have an internal ops team
- You want a dashboard to log into (we deliver via email)
- Your watchlist changes hourly (this is built for consistent monitoring)

I work with relationship-driven businesses because I understand firms where trust, discretion, and personal touch matter. This isn't mass-market automation—it's built specifically for how boutique firms operate.

## FAQ

**Do I need to give you access to our CRM or internal systems?**  
No. We only need your watchlist (company names, key people, sectors). Monitoring happens externally, briefs are delivered via email.

**How do you source the news?**  
We aggregate from public sources—press releases, industry publications, regulatory filings, company announcements—then filter and format what's relevant to your watchlist.

**What if I want to change the watchlist during the free week?**  
Easy. Just email us the changes and we'll update the monitoring same day.

**Can I see a sample before committing to the free week?**  
Yes. Book the 15-minute setup call and I'll show you a mock brief based on a sample portfolio before we configure yours.

**What happens after the free week if I don't continue?**  
Nothing. No payment, no follow-up unless you ask for it. The monitoring just stops.

**How is this different from Google Alerts or Bloomberg?**  
Google Alerts generate 90% noise. Bloomberg costs €24K/year and requires someone to extract what's relevant. We deliver pre-filtered, actionable intelligence at a fraction of the cost.
