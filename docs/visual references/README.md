Why it matters:
- Typography as the primary brand carrier. Large, confident headlines establish presence without relying on imagery or decoration.

- Minimal, almost austere visual language. Very few visual elements are used, and those that appear feel deliberate. This creates a sense of precision and control rather than abundance.

- Strong use of whitespace and rhythm. Content is spaced generously, with clear separation between sections. The page feels calm and intentional, never dense or rushed.

- Confident restraint in calls to action. CTAs are subtle and embedded naturally into the flow. There is no urgency language or visual emphasis beyond what is strictly necessary.
